# Celebration Pop-Ups Task

This project consists of two celebration pop-ups designed using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** for animations. The pop-ups are fully responsive and optimized for both web and mobile devices.

## Pop-Ups Details

### 1. Full-Page Celebration with XP Bar
- A full-page pop-up triggers when a user reaches a new level.
- It includes an animated XP bar and introduces a new badge with smooth animations.

### 2. Compact Reward Celebration
- A smaller pop-up that highlights rewards earned by the user.
- Focuses on the rewards without an XP bar and provides a quicker celebratory moment.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building optimized, fast, and scalable web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and flexible user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: A popular animation library for React, used for smooth animations within the pop-ups.

## Features

- Fully responsive design (mobile and web).
- Dynamic and smooth animations for celebration pop-ups.
- Clean and scalable code structure.
